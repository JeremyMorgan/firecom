FireCom - Washington County Fire / EMS Information System

![image](http://www.jeremymorgan.com/apps/firecom/wccca.png)


FireCom is an application for Android that provides Fire and EMS call information for Washington County, Oregon. It is available for free [here (FireCom on Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeremymorgan.wccca&hl=en). 

This is the web backend for that app. It scrapes the XML feed given out by the WCCCA (911) center and extracts the data from Washington County and formats it for the Android app to read it. 

The Android application is a simple web view app that reads this data. 

###About the Data

This is public information that's provided by WCCCA. It's not perfect so the mapping and station assignments are sometimes innaccurate but for the most part it works very well. 

Since this is public information, I chose not to sell this application, and never will. It will always remain free of charge. 

###How you can use this code

You can use it however you like, but you are liable for how you use it. I would strongly advise against using this application for illegal activity or personal gain. 

Any other legal use is highly encouraged.

###Contributing

You may contribute to this code if you like. I built it in a couple hours a few years ago, and recently refactored it for better performance but it really is a work in progress, and was pretty rushed. If you find something you would like to improve, contact me or submit a pull request.
